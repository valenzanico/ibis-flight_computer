# Ibis project

Ibis are a series of amateur rocket projects. The goal is to build a rocket that can do some crazy stuff.

## Ibis flight computer

One of Ibis rocket advantage will be the flight computer.
Part of the code of the flight computeris derived from the [CHeArIA project](https://github.com/liceocremona/chearia). Mostly the code for the sensors, the communication and the ground station.


## Ibis-1 rocket

The first rocket of the series will be a one stage rocket. It will be powered by a solid fuel commercial rocket of class C or D. The rocket will have a very simple elettronic system, it will be composed only by a flight computer that register on a SD card the data from a MPU6050 sensor. The rocket will be recovered by a parachute.
